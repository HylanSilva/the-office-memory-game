# Hi welcome! :)

Hey! my name is Hylan Silva, but everyone calls me Lano.
I'm studying Vanilla JavaScript to improve and apply it to my career. 
This game is a bit, which I'm learning from in the TQI bootcamp. 
JavaScript Vanilla is very good, and I want to know more about it.

## What i learned during the JavaScript course:

* programming logic.
* algorithms.
* primitive data types.
* composite data types.
* arrays.
* objects
* Object Oriented Programming.
* addEventListener

and more...
